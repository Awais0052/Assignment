<P>
It is very easy to say something about others and even to pass oneâ€™s comments on their activities, good or bad.But it is very difficult to say anything about oneself.<br/>
It is because if one talks highly of oneself,one will be dubbed as an egoist.If one talks lowly of oneself,one may be disparaged as one suffering from an inferiority complex.<br/>
This however,does not pester a man of truth.A man of truth remains unaffected by praise or censure.The concern of such a man is to speak the truth whatever others may think of him.<br/>
My name is Awais Ahmed Khan.I was born on 13th of April 1999,in Attock.Basically,i am from Attock but right now i am living in Tramarri Islamabad.<br/>
I try myself to be modest,passionate,devoted,hardworking and honest.Actually,whatever you will be,it is just because of your family.<br/>
My father name is Mr.Ijaz Ahmed.The most significant and life changing experience in my life was when my father died three years ago.<br/>
It really awakend me to how the world works and how fragile life is.My Mother is an essential and particular person in my life.<br/>
She is very hardworking and caring.She has always been a strong supporter and encourager in my life.If she hasn't taught me how to take small steps,i won't be able to take any action.<br/>
I have grown up with my three elder brothers who never let me feel that i have no sister.I am studying at the best school in my city.<br/>
I have done my matriculation from Govt.Boys High School No:1 Hazro.I have done my intermediate from Govt Boys Degree College Hazro Attock.<br/>
Currently i am doing Bachelor's in computer science From FUUAST Islamabad.I am a very adventurous person too and like to take risk.<br/>
Learning new things is one thing which i always enjoy.Everybody has an ambition in life.Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of man.I want to become a web programmer.<br/>
Without good career planning,right from the start,one can't be on the right track.<br/>
